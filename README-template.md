To directly make the boiler plate:
- just type html:5 tab

In the HTML head section: 
  - <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./images/favicon-32x32.png"> can be used to set the icon.
  - <title></title> is the title displayed in the tab
  - <style> can be set in the HTML document
In the body:
  - <div class="attribution">
    Challenge by <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io?ref=challenge" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor</a>. 
    Coded by <a href="#">Your Name Here</a>.
  </div>
  - #testimonial-1  -> <div id="testimonial-1"></div>
